# 2048

A recreation of the online game 2048. The objective of the game is to combine tiles incrementally by sliding the tiles up, left, down, or right with the w, a, s, or d keys respectively. However players must manage tiles carefully as the fixed 4x4 board may overcrowd with tiles...

GUI is made with Java Swing. Includes mostly all functionality from the original game except animations and playability after achieving 2048. Implemented with a two dimensional array. 

Colors of different tiles are modified from the original game to increase distinguishability.
