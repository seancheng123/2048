# 2048

A recreation of the online game 2048. GUI is made with Java Swing. Includes mostly all functionality from the original game except animations and playability after achieving 2048. 

Implemented with a two dimensional array. 

Colors of different tiles are modified from the original game to increase distinguishability.
